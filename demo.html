                Learning to code isn't easy.

                Your university probably teaches programming through a lab course.
            </section>            

            <section> 
                The first step of the lab, very often, is to make students install a coding environment.
            </section>

            <section>
                This is quite complex. And without the coding environment, you can't start coding.
            </section>

            <section>
                But it doesn't need to be.

                And how did we do this? This is a very simple, "tape-and-glue", MVP.

            <section>
                One day, we would like to simplify this quite a bit, but this is promising for a quick prototype!

                For now, we can make use of all the nice features that you might expect from the components we used.
            </section>

            <section>
                And this is all front-end code! Which means this works even if you are offline (encourage to try).

                Or, more realistically, this means you can integrate ICPs in pretty much any LMS or platform without installing complex components.

                But since we want these to replace slides, you can also download them as a single file.
