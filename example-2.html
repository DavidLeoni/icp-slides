                            independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily

                            This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a

                <h3 class="title">Top-down approach</h3>
                <div style="width: 70vw;">
                    <p>The basic idea in top-down approach is to <span class="emph">break</span> a complex algorithm
                        or a problem <span class="emph">into smaller segments</span> called modules, this process is
                        also called as modularization. The modules are further decomposed
                        until there is no space left for breaking the modules without
                        hampering the originality. The uniqueness of the problem must be
                        retained and preserved. The decomposition of the modules is
                        restricted after achieving a certain level of modularity. The top-down
                        way of solving a program is step-by-step process of breaking down
                        the problem into chunks for organising and solving the sole problem.
                        The C- programming language uses the top-down approach of solving
                        a problem in which the flow of control is in the downward direction.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Bottom-up approach</h3>
                <p class="subtitle">Bottom up programming is the opposite of top-down programming</p>
                <div style="width: 70vw;">
                    <p>In this approach we <span class="emph">start</span> working <span class="emph">from the most
                            basic level of problem
                            solving and moving up</span> in conjugation of several parts of the solution to
                        achieve required results. The most fundamental units, modules and sub-
                        modules are designed and solved individually, these units are then
                        integrated together to get a more concrete base to problem solving.</p>
                    <p>
                        This bottom-up approach works in <span class="emph">different phases or layers</span>. Each
                        module
                        designed is tested at fundamental level that means unit testing is done
                        before the integration of the individual modules to get solution. Unit
                        testing is accomplished using low-level functions, that is another topic we
                        will talk about later.

                <div style="width: 70vw;">
                    <p>Stubs are used during Top-down integration testing, in order to
                        <span class="emph">simulate the behaviour of the lower-level modules that are not yet
                            integrated</span>. Stubs are the modules that act as temporary replacement
                        for a called module and give the same output as that of the actual
                        product.

                    <p>
                        Stubs are also used when the software needs to interact with an
                        external system.

                <h3 class="title">Advantages of the bottom-up approach</h3>
                <div style="width: 70vw;">
                    <p>Bottom-up programming has several <span class="emph">advantages over top-down
                            programming</span>. Testing is simplified since <span class="emph">no stubs are
                            needed</span>. While it
                        might be necessary to write <span class="emph">test functions</span>, these are simpler to write
                        than stubs, and sometimes not necessary at all.</p>
                    <p>Pieces of programs written bottom-up tend to be more general, and
                        thus <span class="emph">more reusable</span>, than pieces of programs written top-down.</p>
                    <p>It also makes it possible to <span class="emph">delay the final decision</span> concerning the
                        exact functionality of the application. Being able to delay this decision
                        makes it less likely that the client has changed his or her mind
                        between the establishment of the specifications of the application
                        and its implementation.</p>
